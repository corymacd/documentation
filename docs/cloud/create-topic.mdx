After you create a cluster, you can create a topic for that cluster.

2. From the left menu, select **Topics**.
    The **Topics** page displays the current list of topics.
3. Click **Create Topic**.
    The **Create Topic** dialog box opens.
4. In **Topic Name**, type a name for your topic.
5. In **Partitions**, type the number of partitions for the topic. The default is 1.
6. In **Replication Factor**, type the number of partition replicas for the topic. Three replicas are recommended.
7. In **Min In-sync Replicas**, type the minimum number of partition replicas that must be kept in sync with the leader partition. This number must be equal to or less than the number of replicas.
8. In **Cleanup Policy**, select delete or compact.
9. In **Retention Time (ms)**, select the maximum length of time to keep messages in a topic. The default is 7 days.
10. In **Retention Size (Bytes)**, select the maximum size of each partition. If a partition reaches this size and more messages are added, the oldest messages are deleted. The default is infinite.

The **Topics** page adds the topic you created to the list of topics.
