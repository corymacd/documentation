After you create a cluster, you can create a topic for that cluster.

1. From the **Home** page, select the cluster you want to use for creating a topic.
2. From the left menu, select **Topics**.
    The **Topics** page displays the current list of topics.
3. Click **Create Topic**.
    The **Create Topic** dialog box opens.
4. In **Topic Name**, type a name for your topic.
5. In **Partitions**, type the number of partitions for the topic. The default is 1.
6. In **Replication Factor**, type the number of partition replicas for the topic. The default is 1, although three replicas are recommended.
7. In **Min In-sync Replicas**, type the minimum number of partition replicas that must be kept in sync with the leader partition. This number must be equal to or less than the number of replicas. The default is 1.
8. In **Cleanup Policy**, select **delete** or **compact**. The default is **delete**.
9. In **Retention Time (ms)**, select the maximum length of time to keep messages in a topic. The default is 7 days.
10. In **Retention Size (Bytes)**, select the maximum size of each partition. If a partition reaches this size and more messages are added, the oldest messages are deleted. The default is infinite.
11. (Optional) Under **Additional Configuration**, add more topic properties.
    Redpanda supports all Apache Kafka topic configuration properties and all Redpanda-specific [topic configuration properties](../../core/reference/cluster-properties#Topics-and-partitions).
12. Click **Create**.
13. When the success message appears, click **Close**.

The **Topics** page displays the topic you created to the list of topics.
