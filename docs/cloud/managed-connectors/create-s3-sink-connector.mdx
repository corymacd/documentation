The Amazon S3 Sink connector exports data from Kafka topics to S3 objects in JSON format.

## Prerequisites

Before you can create an S3 sink connector in the Redpanda Console, you must complete the following tasks:

* In the AWS management console, create an S3 bucket associated with your AWS account ID.
* In the AWS management console, create an IAM policy to govern access to the bucket. The AWS account that accesses the S3 bucket must have the following permissions:
    * ListAllMyBuckets
    * ListBucket
    * GetBucketLocation
    * PutObject
    * GetObject
    * AbortMultipartUpload
    * ListMultipartUploadParts
    * ListBucketMultipartUploads
* In the Redpanda Console, [create a topic](./create-topic).
