Redpanda offers two ways to provision clusters in the cloud:
* Dedicated Cloud
* Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)

## Dedicated Cloud

Dedicated cloud clusters allow you to host your data in Redpandaâ€™s Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and have Redpanda handle the provisioning, operations, and maintenance for you. Redpanda also performs automatic backups to S3 (for AWS) or GCS (for GCP).

## BYOC

BYOC allows you to deploy Redpanda in your own VPC, keeping all data in your own environment, while still having Redpanda handle provisioning, monitoring, and upgrades. You can choose AWS or GCP as your cloud provider.
The following architecture diagram illustrates the communication between the control plane and the data plane when you use a VPC in AWS:
