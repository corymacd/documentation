To create a Redpanda cluster in the Dedicated Cloud, log in to the Redpanda Cloud, then follow the steps for creating a cluster.


## Log in to Redpanda Cloud

To log in to the Redpanda Cloud, add a namespace, and select Dedicated Cloud for deploying your Redpanda cluster:

1. Go to the Redpanda cloud URL and click **Log in**.
The **Enter Organization** page opens.
2. Type your organization name and click **Continue**.
    The Home page appears.
3. Click **Add namespace**.
    Namespaces help you organize clusters by owner, team, or project for example.
4. Type a name for your namespace.
5. Scroll to your namespace (namespaces are listed in alphabetical order) and click **+ Add Cluster**.
6. Select **Dedicated cloud**.

## Create a cluster

After you select Dedicated cloud, create a Redpanda cluster:

1. Click **Create Dedicated cluster**.
    The **Create dedicated cluster** page opens at the **Cluster settings** step.
2. (Optional) In **Cluster name**, type a name to replace the default name.
3. Select throughput. The choices are 1 MBps, 5 MBps, 10 MBps, and 20 MBps.
4. Open the **Redpanda version** menu and select a version.
6. Click **Next**.
    The **Cloud settings** page opens.
7. For **Provider**, select AWS.
8. Open the **Region** menu and select a region.
    Choose the region that is geographically closest to you.
9. Open the **Zones** menu and select three availability zones for your region.
10. Click **Next**.
    The **Networking** page opens.
11. Under **Connection Type**, select either **Public Network** or **Private - VPC Peering**.
12. Click **Create**.

The system displays the message “Cluster creation can take a while. This page will refresh when cluster creation is complete.”
After the cluster is created, you can click on the cluster name on the **Home** page to see the **Overview** page for that cluster. The **Overview** page contains the following information:
* Cluster health
* Cluster details, including name, ID, type (Dedicated or BYOC), and cloud provider
* How to connect to Kafka API, Schema registry, and HTTP Proxy
* Links to resources, such as documentation, CLI tools, and Support
