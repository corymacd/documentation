The Transactions API guarantees both exactly-once semantics and atomicity. 
- Exactly-once semantics helps developers avoid the anomalies of at-most-once processing (with potential lost events) and at-least-once processing (with potential duplicated events). Redpanda supports exactly-once semantics with [Idempotent Producers](/docs/development/idempotent-producers). 
- Atomicity additionally commits a set of messages across partitions as a unit: either all messages are committed, or none. Encapsulated data received or sent across multiple topics into a single operation can only succeed or fail globally. 

If a producer is sending a message, and network connectivity or broker failure cause the producer to retry sending the message, the consumer gets the message once and only once, or the transaction fails. This is important for applications that require specific guarantees of message delivery, like financial transactions.

Because the Transactions API is part of the Kafka API, you can use your favorite client libraries to work with it. For example, you can fetch messages starting from the last consumed offset and transactionally process them one by one, updating the last consumed offset and producing events at the same time. And because Redpanda transactions are about 6x faster than Kafka's, you see improved throughput and latency.

## Enabling transactions

Idempotence must be enabled to use transactions. By default, the following cluster properties are enabled: `enable_idempotence` and `enable_transactions`. See [Idempotent Producers](/docs/development/idempotent-producers). 

To facilitate transactions, increase the replication factor of the internal topic in the following properties: 
   - `id_allocator_replication: 3`
   - `transaction_coordinator_replication: 3`

:::note
Make sure `transaction_coordinator_delete_retention_ms` is at least as high as `transactional_id_expiration_ms`. The default setting for both properties is 604800000 ms (1 week). If you increase `transactional_id_expiration_ms`, you must increase `transaction_coordinator_delete_retention_ms` by at least the same amount.
