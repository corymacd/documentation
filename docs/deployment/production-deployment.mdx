This section describes how to set up a production cluster of Redpanda.

To try out Redpanda, see the 60-second guides for
[Linux](/docs/quickstart/quick-start-linux), [MacOS](/docs/quickstart/quick-start-macos),
[Docker](/docs/quickstart/quick-start-docker), or [Kubernetes](/docs/quickstart/kubernetes-qs-cloud).

:::note
Before you set up your Redpanda cluster, see [Managing Disk Space](/docs/deployment/disk-utilization.mdx) for guidelines on cluster creation.

## Prepare infrastructure

For best performance, provision hardware according to these requirements:

- XFS for the data directory of Redpanda (`/var/lib/redpanda/data`)
- A kernel that is at least 3.10.0-514, 4.18 or newer is preferred
- Local NVMe, RAID-0 when using multiple disks
- 2GB of memory per core
- TCP ports:
  - `33145` - internal RPC port
  - `9092` - Kafka API port
  - `8082` - HTTP Proxy port
  - `8081` - Schema Registry port
  - `9644` - Prometheus and HTTP admin port

You can use [Terraform to deploy Redpanda](/docs/deployment/production-deployment-automation).

## Install Redpanda

After the hardware is provisioned, install Redpanda and configure it for production use.

You can also install Redpanda using an [Ansible playbook](/docs/deployment/production-deployment-automation).

### Install the binary

Install the binary on either Fedora/RedHat or Debian systems.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="fedora" label="Fedora/RedHat" default>

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://packages.vectorized.io/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.rpm.sh' | \
sudo -E bash && sudo yum install redpanda -y
```


  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="debian" label="Debian">

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://packages.vectorized.io/nzc4ZYQK3WRGd9sy/redpanda/cfg/setup/bash.deb.sh' | \
sudo -E bash && sudo apt install redpanda -y
```


  </TabItem>

### Set Redpanda production mode

By default, Redpanda is installed in development mode, which turns off hardware optimization.

To enable hardware optimization, set Redpanda to run in production mode:

```bash
sudo rpk redpanda mode production
```

To tune the hardware, on each node:

```bash
sudo rpk redpanda tune all
```

:::note Optional: Benchmark your SSD
On taller machines, Redpanda recommends benchmarking your SSD. This can be done
with `rpk iotune`. You only need to run this once. For reference, a local NVMe SSD should yield around 1GB/s sustained writes.
`rpk iotune` captures SSD wear and tear and gives accurate measurements
of what your hardware is capable of delivering. Run this before benchmarking.

If you're on AWS, GCP, or Azure, creating a new instance and upgrading to
an image with a recent Linux kernel version is often the easiest way to
work around bad devices.

```bash
sudo rpk iotune # takes 10mins
```

### Instantiate Redpanda

There are two ways to instantiate Redpanda: explicit initialization (recommended) or implicit initialization (default). 

#### Explicit initialization (recommended)

The explicit initialization process enables easier deployment with simplified configuration of node IDs and seed servers. 

Redpanda automatically generates node IDs, so you don't need to include node IDs in config files or worry about policies on `node_id` re-use. Redpanda initially starts up without an ID, and the node gets an ID only after it joins the cluster. 

Additionally, all nodes can have identical `seed_servers` in their config file. The minimum number of seed servers to form a cluster is three, but you can adjust this to increase the robustness of consensus and minimize any chance that new clusters get spuriously formed after nodes are lost or restarted without any data. 

It's important to have one of more seed servers in each fault domain (such as rack, cloud AZ). A higher number provides a stronger guarantee that clusters donâ€™t fracture unintentionally.

#### Implicit initialization (default)

Implicit initialization is supported for backward compatibility. This process is more complex. It requires that each node have a unique `node_id` set in its config file, and exactly one node must have `seed_servers` empty in its config file. 

You first configure and start the root node. The root node starts as a standalone node, and every other node joins it, forming a cluster along the way. You must be careful not to add new nodes with the same `node_id` as decommissioned nodes. For the root node, choose 0 as its ID. The `--self` option tells the node which interface address to bind to. Usually you want that to be its private IP.

```bash
sudo rpk config bootstrap --id 0 --self <ip> && \
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
```

For every other node, you have to choose a unique integer ID for it, and let
it know where to reach the root node.

```bash
sudo rpk config bootstrap --id <unique id> \
--self <private ip>                        \
--ips <root node ip> &&                    \
sudo systemctl start redpanda-tuner redpanda
```

If clients will connect from a different subnet, see [Configuring Listeners](/docs/cluster-administration/listener-configuration).

### Verify the installation

To verify that the cluster is up and running, check the logs:

```bash
journalctl -u redpanda
```

To create a topic:

```bash
rpk topic create panda
```
